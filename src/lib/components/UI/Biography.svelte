      <p><strong>Kaan Peeters </strong></p>
      <p><strong>I create moments, music, and songs.</strong><br />
      <br />
      I was born on May 23, 1996, in Bad Zurzach, Switzerland.<br />
      I studied jazz piano under Chris Wiesendanger and David Virelles at the Zurich University of the Arts, completing my Master of Arts in Education in 2023. I also received organ instruction from Tobias Willi during his studies.<br />
      As the founder and leader of the &#39;Kaan Peeters Quartet,&#39; as well as the organization &#39;IMPROS,&#39; and the subsequent &#39;IMPROS Festival,&#39; I currently work as a pianist, organist, composer, author, event organizer, and educator.<br />
      I&#39;m currently residing in Zurich, working on various things. If you&#39;re interested you can find me on events listed on this page, as well as find my content at:</p>
